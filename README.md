# 🌈 Color-Based Pathfinding Visualization on AI-Generated Images

## 🚀 Overview
Embark on a visual journey through the realms of pathfinding! This interactive Python tool allows users to explore various pathfinding algorithms by applying them to user-loaded images. By selecting start and end points, you can witness how different algorithms traverse the landscape to uncover the shortest path. The visualization highlights the path found with a vibrant blue line, while explored pixels are represented in striking negative colors.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Import any image of your choice to visualize pathfinding.
- **Interactive Point Selection**: Directly click on the image to set your starting and ending points.
- **Diverse Algorithm Selection**: Choose from a variety of pathfinding algorithms, including:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Floyd-Warshall
  - Bellman-Ford
- **Rich Visual Feedback**: The path is depicted with a blue line, and explored pixels are showcased in negative colors.
- **Cost Calculation**: Automatically computes costs based on multiple distance metrics, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distances.

## 📦 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monthenry/Pathfinding-Visualizer.git
cd Pathfinding-Visualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖥️ Usage
Launch the application using the following command:

```bash
